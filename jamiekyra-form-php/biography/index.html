						<p><strong>Jamie Kyra O'Keeffe, Ph.D., is a researcher, educator and meditator committed to cultivating the best in the human spirit</strong>. Jamie Kyra's research focuses on student stress in high-achieving schools, where expectations to "be the best" can overshadow genuine connection. Through innovative educational experiences, she helps students, parents, teachers and school leaders reduce stress and cultivate wellness.</p>
						<p>She shares talks and workshops on alleviating student stress through mindfulness, compassion and authentic relating. She previously taught courses on the culture of success and radical compassion at Stanford University. All of her courses draw heavily from her research, as well as her personal experiences as a meditator, student and lecturer at Stanford.</p>
						<p>Jamie O'Keeffe holds a Ph.D. in the Learning Sciences from the Stanford Graduate School of Education, an Ed.M. from the Harvard Graduate School of Education in Mind, Brain and Education, and a B.A. in Psychology from Middlebury College. She has always had one foot in academic institutions and the other foot in spiritual centers, such as Esalen and the Omega Institute for Holistic Studies. Her work arose out of her own struggle to balance the head and the heart while in school. She understands stress from the inside out: first, she lived it; then, she studied it; finally, she healed it. Now she helps others find a way out.</p>
